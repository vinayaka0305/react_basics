// the process of react componet
// from mounting to unmount(from current to next page the previous will unmount)
// this process if called life cyle of component 
//there are 3 main stages in life
// 1.mounting 
// 2.updating
// 3.unmounting

1. Mounting->

* first constructor will run and the second render will run
* render is common in updating also
* after render runs react will update the DOM(what jsx we return that will show in page)
* after DOM updation the component didMount method will run

 componentDidMount ->
 (constructor,render,componentDidMount)
 -constructor method will call only one time
 - this method is used to access the DOM and for api call;
 - we can call api and accessing dom inside this method only;
 - it will run only time after the component mounts
 - this method is equivalent to useEffect hook function component with empty dependency


 componentDidUpdate->

  (render,componentUpdate)
  - this method will run when ever the state and props are gets updated
  - after the component will be rerender 
  - this method is equivalent to useEffect hook function component with variable in dependency

componentWillUnmount->

- this method will update when we go from current page to another page
-this method is equivalent to
- useEffect hook function after we return
